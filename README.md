# Halo 1 - Ashes

This is my first completed halo map. This project was started years ago, even before the release
of the MCC on PC with its new and improved Mod Tools. It was an attempt to see how far I 
could push myself with design, modeling, texturing. The map has gone through many changes as it was being worked on.
Some purely due to artistic choice and some necessary due to the engine limitations I was discovering along the way.
After a couple years of abandonment, it saw new life with the release of the Mod Tools; I had decided to resurrect it and finally finish it once and for all.

The map uses custom geometry, custom texture and shaders, custom sounds and custom particle effects.
However it does not feature any new mechanics, weapons or characters, as I wanted to keep the Halo feel as much as possible.
## Lore

Installation 01 is a forgotten and dangerous place. It's descovery, by scientist Robin Hale, sparked an insatiable interest to explore its surface. 
Radio scans turned out to be inconclusive, as the thick atmosphere that surrounds the seemingly deserted ring has proven almost impenetrable. A group
of spartans was sent to investigate. However, they realized a little too late that the ashy, corrosive air was too distructive for the landig pods they used to reach the surface.
